            <h2>8. Exclusivity Requirements</h2>
            <h3>8.1 For Systems Valued ₱25,000 - ₱100,000</h3>
            <p>During your listing period and for 30 days after removal, you agree to exclusively market and sell your system through Systemly. You may not use competing platforms, brokers, or services without written permission.</p>

            <h3>8.2 For Systems Valued ₱100,000 - ₱15,000,000</h3>

            <h2>9. Marketplace Circumvention Prohibition</h2>
            <p><strong>Critical Rule:</strong> All inquiries, discussions, and transactions related to listed systems must occur through the Systemly Platform. You must not:</p>

                <li>Accept payment outside Systemly's approved methods</li>

                <li>Use Systemly to generate leads for external transactions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a transaction occurs involving a system discovered through Systemly, we are entitled to our success fee regardless of where payment is processed. If we cannot collect from the seller, the buyer becomes liable.</p>

            <h2>10. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>

            </ul>

            <h3>10.2 Success Fees</h3>
            <p>When a system sells through Systemly (including via platform connections or leads), the seller pays a success fee calculated as a percentage of the final sale price. See our Success Fee Page for current rates. Success fees are:</p>
